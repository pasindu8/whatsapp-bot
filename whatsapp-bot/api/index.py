# IMPORTANT: It's best practice to use environment variables for sensitive data like tokens.
# For Vercel, you would set these in your project settings:
# Project Settings -> Environment Variables
INSTANCE_ID = "instance127525" # Replace with your actual Ultramsg Instance ID
TOKEN = "anay3jh9z0gtsqra45ggg"   # Replace with your actual Ultramsg Token

# Alternatively, if you set them as environment variables in Vercel:
# INSTANCE_ID = os.environ.get("ULTRAMSG_INSTANCE_ID")
# TOKEN = os.environ.get("ULTRAMSG_TOKEN")
# Make sure to set these variables in your Vercel project settings.
